## New 2019 Detection Methods

There are optimization in backbone, IoU,NMS, anchor, one shot learning/zero shot learning, etc.

- backboneï¼šResNet, XCeption, DenseNet, FPN, DeNet, R-CNN, PANet, etc
- Optimization: unit box, IoU-Net, etc.
- Loss based optimization: L1, L2, focal loss, etc.
- NMS based: Soft-NMS, Softer-NMS, Relation Network, ConvNMS, NMS Network, Yes-Ne, etc.
- Anchor-based: sliding window, region poporal network(RPN), CornetNet, meta-anchor, etc.
- One-shot-learning, zero shot learning. FSAF
